**Note**: As MKS Robin Nano V2.0 doesn't has an independent serial port, so if using with the MKS H43, V2.0 cannot work with Wifi module, but V3.0 can make it.

## Hardware
The hardware design is openned source on : https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-Robin-Nano-V3.X/tree/main/hardware

## Firmware
The factory firmware of Nano V3 is based on Marlin 2.x, actually, we directly use the same respository of Nano V1.2/2.0:https://github.com/makerbase-mks/Mks-Robin-Nano-Marlin2.0-Firmware. Just modify the type of motherboard to compile the related firmware.

Now Nano V3 also supports RepRapFirmware (RRF). For details, please refer to:https://github.com/makerbase-mks/RepRapFirmware-for-MKS-Boards

Nano V3 has supported klipper firmware. For details, please refer to:https://github.com/makerbase-mks/Klipper-for-MKS-Boards
